# ZotFile: Advanced PDF management for Zotero
### Joscha Legewie

Zotfile is a Zotero plugin to manage your attachments: automatically rename, move, and attach PDFs (or other files) to Zotero items, sync PDFs from your Zotero library to your (mobile) PDF reader (e.g. an iPad, Android tablet, etc.) and extract annotations from PDF files.

Detailed information are available from the [zotfile website](http://www.jlegewie.com/zotfile.html).

## Installation
The currently released version (3.x) is available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zotfile/).

To install the development version on github:

1. download `.zip` file from github
2. extract `.zip` file
3. recreate `.zip` file containing all the files at the top level, i.e.,
  install.rdf and the chrome directory need to be at the root of the .zip file
  and not under zotfile/
4. rename the file to `.xpi`
5. Install
  - For zotero firefox: drag & drop on firefox
  - For zotero standalone: In Zotero Standalone go to 'Tools->Add-ons->Tools for all Add-ons (the small, drop-down wheel menu next to the 'Search all Add-ons' box)->Install Add-on From File' and pick the .xpi file.

For Linux, Mac OS X or Cygwin users, there is a `Makefile` which takes care of creating the `.xpi` file.
Simply run `make` instead of steps 3 and 4 above.

## Extraction of PDF Annotations

Zotfile can extracted annotations and highlighted text from many PDF files. But it will never be able to handle all files. If you can not copy & paste meaningful text from the file in your pdf viewer (open your pdf viewer (not the browser plugin), select text, copy and paste it somewhere), zotfile won't be able to extract the highlighted text either. If you can, there is a chance that future versions of zotfile will solve the problem. In general, these files depend on the pdf standards supported by pdf.js, which is the pdf library used by zotfile to extract annotations.

## Changelog

#### Changes in 3.0

- **Improved extraction of annotation**

    The extraction of pdf annotations using pdf.js works much better now! Zotfile uses a modified version of the updated [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) library ([here](https://github.com/jlegewie/pdf.js) is the fork). The new version supports more pdf standards, detects spaces more precisely, sorts annotations in the correct order, and future updates to new versions of pdf.js are relatively easy. There are still  pdfs that won't work though! Some pdf standards are not yet supported and if you can not copy & paste text from the pdf file using your pdf viewer (e.g. Preview), it's unlikely that zotfile can help.

- **Goto annotation in pdf**

    The extracted annotations now include a link that opens the pdf file on the corresponding page. For the extracted annotation `"This is my text" (zotfile 2013: 4)`, `zotfile 2013: 4` is a link that opens the pdf on the page with the annotation. Currently, this feature only works from reports (right-click on item and select `generate report`) but future version of Zotero might be able to open the links directly from the note (see discussion [here](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/15186/clickable-links-in-notes/) and [here](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/25832/note-hyperlinks-in-standalone/))

- **Tablet feature: Restrict saved search for tablet files to sub-folders**

    You can now right-click on the two saved searches for tablet files and restrict them to one of your custom sub-folders. This is very helpful to quickly see the files that are in a specific sub-folder.

- **Tablet feature: Support of colored tags in Zotero 4**

    Zotfile now tags the parent item when an attachment is send to the tablet so that you can easily see which items are on the tablet. Simply assign colors to the two tablet tags (`_tablet` and `_tablet_modified`). But DO NOT manually add the tag to items or attachments (also not using the keys for colored tags).
    <!-- The new version includes two major changes that allow you to work with colored tags. First, zotfile now also tags the parent item when an attachment is send to the tablet. As a result, you can easily see which items are on the tablet and also which items have been modified. Second, using the keys associated with colored tags, you can now send attachments to the tablet and get them back with a simple keystroke. Note that the two tablet tags (`_tablet` and `_tablet_modified`) behave like one tag for key presses: pressing the key for either of the two tags *always* sends attachments to the tablet or gets them back. An attachment, for example, might only have the `_tablet_modified` tag because it was modified but pressing the key for the tablet tag `_tablet` still removes the attachment from the tablet and therefore *does not* assign the `_tablet` tag. To use these features, simply assign colors to the two tablet tags (`_tablet` and `_tablet_modified`). -->

#### Changes in 2.3

- **enhanced renaming rules** (thanks to [Midnighter](https://github.com/Midnighter))

    1) Optional wild-cards: `{-%y}` only includes `-` if  `%y` is defined.

    2) Exclusive wild-cards: `%s|%j` journal abbr. or if not defined full journal name.

    (for examples see below)

- additional wild-cards for author formating (author initials `%I` and lastnameF `%F`), pages (`%f`) and short title (`%h`)
- **watch source folder for new files**

    Whenever the focus changes to the item list in Zotero, Zotfile checks for new files in the source folder. If a new file was added to the folder, zotfile uses a clickable, non-disruptive window to ask the user whether s/he wants to attach that file to the currently selected Zotero item.

- **revised auto rename with additional options**

    Four options: Never, Always ask, Only ask if item has other atts, Always rename. The 'asking' uses a clickable, non-disruptive window that appears in the bottom right corner - same as previous info window but clickable.

- **revised notifications and error handling**
- **Zotfile translation to German** (thanks to [wuffi](https://github.com/wuffi)) **and French** (thanks to [gracile-fr](https://github.com/gracile-fr))

- new option: "lower case" filenames (thanks to [jjatria](https://github.com/jjatria))
- new option: disable renaming so that attachments are only moved (hidden: `.disable_renaming`)
- new option: set opening and closing quotation mark for extracted annotations (hidden: `.openingQuotationMarks`, `.closingQuotationMarks`)
- new option: remove periods from filenames (hidden: `removePeriods`)
- bug fix: download of poppler tool was broken
- bug fix: preview of renaming rules for Unix and Windows
- bug fix: sending to and getting from tablet deleted note content

**Examples for enhanced renaming rules**
`%j` - journal; `%s` - journal abbreviation

`{%a}{-%y}{-%j (%s)}` - `author-2001-Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)`
(if either `%j` or `%s` is empty, `author-2001`)

`{%a-}{%y-}{%s|%j}` - `author-2001-PNAS` or `author-2001-Proceedings...` if `%s` is empty
