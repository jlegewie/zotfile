# ZotFile: Zotero plugin to manage your attachments
### Joscha Legewie

Zotfile is a Zotero plugin to manage your attachments: automatically rename, move, and attach PDFs (or other files) to Zotero items, sync PDFs from your Zotero library to your (mobile) PDF reader (e.g. an iPad, Android tablet, etc.) and extract annotations from PDF files.

Detailed information are available from the [zotfile website](http://www.jlegewie.com/zotfile.html).

## Installation
The currently released version (2.x) is available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zotfile/).

To install the development version on github:

- download .zip file from github
- extract .zip file
- recreate .zip file containing all the files at the top level, i.e.,
  install.rdf and the chrome directory need to be at the root of the zip file
  and not under zotfile/
- rename the file to .xpi
- For zotero firefox: drag & drop on firefox
- For zotero standalone: In Zotero Standalone go to 'Tools->Add-ons->Tools for all Add-ons (the small, drop-down wheel menu next to the 'Search all Add-ons' box)->Install Add-on From File' and pick the .xpi file.
